# Monochrome Dark
jtpotato's flavour

Made to look like something Vercel would make... or if VSCode had a clean subtly emo theme???

From the original:

---

A simple dark monochrome color theme, inspired by in-the-box's [Simple Dark Mode](https://github.com/in-the-box/vscode-simple-dark-mode) theme for VS Code, and anler's [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/anler/minimal-theme) for Emacs.

It is code, not fruit salad.
